## Using Machine Learning to Improve Heart Attack Survivability in Hospitals

This is the Final Project for my Machine Learning Supervised Learning course.

Cardiovascular disease, including heart disease, remains a significant global health challenge, claiming millions of lives each year and placing a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide. In response to this pressing issue, I have chosen to do my project dedicated to advancing our understanding and management of heart disease. I believe that machine learning holds the potential to enhance the way we approach cardiovascular health, from early risk prediction to personalized treatment strategies. My project aims to improve the accuracy of heart disease diagnosis, enhance risk assessment, and, ultimately, contribute to better healthcare outcomes by enabling timely interventions and more effective healthcare delivery.

Thank you for reviewing and have a great day!
